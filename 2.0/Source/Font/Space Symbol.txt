Space Symbol.

You need to set the width of your space. You don't have to put any shape in
there but space is a glyph and if the slot is empty it will present your
default glyph if pressed. Select the space slot in the font view and use
Metrics> Set Width, and give it any number greater than zero (though it
should be about half to two thirds the average width of your lowercase
letters).
